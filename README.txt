There are three main files: index.html, appt.html and style.css.
The index.html file is the homepage and through there you access the appt.html file by 
clicking on "schedule an appointment‚Äù. All the images I used are in the img folder.

During the development of this website I used a personal localhost server (Atom live server) to host the website. However,whenever I run the file locally (by just clicking on the .html file), one of the pictures does not seem to load. I don't think it should be a problem since the website will be run on a server anyways.
